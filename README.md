It is common knowledge that the Great Firewall of China blocks many websites.

Some examples of known blocked domains are:

 - googleapis.com
 - gstatic.com
 - facebook.com
 - fonts.google.com
 - maps.google.com
 - twitter.com
 - github.com
 - 
 
As you can see by the list above, if you know anything about WordPress, you will immediately notice that all of these are included in WordPress Core and essential WordPress Plugins used for Social Media sharing and other functionality.
 
How then, do foreigners in the People's Republic of China get access to blocked websites?

1. VPNs (Astrill VPN, PureVPN, ExpressVPN, HotSpot Shield, Chinese VPNs, etc.)
2. 'Chopped' versions of WordPress.
